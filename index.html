        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello! My name is Gilmarie Hernandez." width="200">
        <p>Hi! My name is Gilmarie Hernandez but I go by Jill (It's easier to pronounce). I was born in Puerto Rico and currently live in North Carolina. I am the oldest of 3 girls and have a 3 year old daughter named Emerita, Emmie for short.
        <p>I have recently gotten into paddle boarding which has been awesome since I have lakes close to me and if I wanted to go on a little weekend adventure to paddle board, the beach is just a 3 hour drive.
            Besides paddle boarding, I enjoy watching movies over reading a book. When there is a movie I want to watch that is based off a book, I won't read the book since I know it will ruin the movie for me. 
            If you have ever read 'Twilight' and then watched the movies, you know what I mean.</p> 
        <p>I love travelling! I want to show my daughter the world so every year for her birthday, rather than doing a party with her friends, I plan a trip
            to a new place. Most of these trips have in the US since she's still young and I don't think she will do well on a long flight right now with the energy she has.
        </p>

        <p>North Carolina is the 9th most populous state in the US. The first successful flight happened right here in the Outer Banks area by the Wright Brothers. Fun Fact: NC is the largest producers of sweet potatoes!!</p>
