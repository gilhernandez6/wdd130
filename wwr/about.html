            </article>
            <p class="p1">The history of Wilderness Wave Riders is one as unique as the next. Three sister with a joy
                of life, wanting to step out of their comfort zone and push their limits. They have always had a 
                sense of adventure but really wanted to get away from it all at the same time. <br>
                <br>
                On of of their exersions, they decided to try "roughing" it. Leave their "Corporate America" lives for a
                bit and try something completely out fo the norm for them. So they sold as much of their belongings as 
                possible, packed their bags, bought a RV and sailed out to see what life had to offer.
            </p>
            <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="The Beginning">
            <p class="p2">One night while camping under the magnificent night sky somewhere in northern New York,
                the three sisters discussed their plans for the next day and decided on a white water rafting trip.
                They found it curious that none of them have ever done such a thing and were excited about doing some new.
                <br>
                <br>
                The next morning, they were off rafting down the Hudson River and had the bewst time of their lives. 
                They loved the unknown. The next wave, was it going to take them down? This set them off into thinking, what if
                we can do this all the time? So they did and Wilderness Wave Riders was born!
